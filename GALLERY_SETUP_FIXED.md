2. **Gallery.jsx** - Dedicated gallery page (shows all images)
3. **AdminGallery.jsx** - Admin interface for managing gallery images
4. **cloudinary.js** - Simplified Cloudinary integration utilities
5. **CloudinaryDebug.jsx** - Debug component to check configuration

### 🔧 Setup Required:

#### 1. Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration (ONLY these two are needed)
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset_name
```

**Important**: You only need the cloud name and upload preset for unsigned uploads. API key and secret are not required.

#### 2. Cloudinary Setup

1. Create account at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Get your cloud name from the dashboard
3. Create an **unsigned upload preset**:
   - Go to Settings > Upload
   - Create new preset
   - Set to "Unsigned"
   - Allow unsigned uploads
   - Copy the preset name exactly

#### 3. Firebase Collection Structure

The gallery uses a `gallery` collection with this structure:

```javascript
{
  title: "Image Title",
  description: "Image description",
  category: "Events|Artwork|Team|Projects|Community|Other",
  imageUrl: "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
  publicId: "cloudinary_public_id",
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

### 🎯 How to Use:

#### For Admins:

1. Go to `/admin/gallery`
2. Check the debug panel for configuration status
3. Click "Add New Image"
4. Upload image, add title, description, and category
5. Images automatically appear on Home page and Gallery page

#### For Users:

1. **Home Page**: See 6 random gallery images with hover effects
2. **Gallery Page**: Click "Go to Gallery" or navigate to `/gallery`
3. **Image Details**: Click any image to see full details in modal

### 🚀 Routes Added:

- `/gallery` - Main gallery page
- `/admin/gallery` - Admin gallery management
- Gallery section integrated into Home page

### 🐛 Troubleshooting:

#### Common Issues Fixed:

1. **"Cloudinary configuration missing" error**:

   - ✅ Fixed: Added environment variable validation
   - ✅ Fixed: Added debug panel to show configuration status
   - Check your `.env.local` file has the correct variables
   - Ensure variable names start with `VITE_`
   - Restart your development server after adding env variables

2. **Upload fails with 400/401 error**:

   - ✅ Fixed: Simplified upload function without cloudinary package dependency
   - ✅ Fixed: Better error handling and logging
   - Verify your upload preset is set to "Unsigned"
   - Check that the preset name matches exactly
   - Ensure your Cloudinary account is active

3. **Images not showing on frontend**:

   - ✅ Fixed: Added better error handling in components
   - ✅ Fixed: Added loading states
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify Firestore rules allow reading from `gallery` collection
   - Ensure images are being saved to Firestore correctly

4. **Debug Information**:
   - ✅ Added: Debug panel on admin page showing configuration status
   - ✅ Added: Console logging for upload process
   - ✅ Added: Better error messages
   - Check browser console for detailed error messages
   - Verify network requests in browser dev tools

### 📱 Responsive Features:

- Touch-friendly interactions
- Responsive modal design
- Loading states and error handling

### 🔒 Security Notes:

- Images are uploaded directly to Cloudinary (no server required)
- Firestore rules should restrict gallery collection access
- Upload preset should be unsigned for client-side uploads
- Consider implementing server-side deletion for production

### 🛠️ What Was Fixed:

1. **Removed cloudinary package dependency** - Uses direct API calls instead
2. **Fixed syntax errors** - Corrected function declarations
3. **Added environment variable validation** - Checks config before upload
4. **Improved error handling** - Better error messages and logging
5. **Added debug component** - Shows configuration status
6. **Fixed unused imports** - Cleaned up linter warnings
7. **Added detailed logging** - Console logs for debugging

The gallery is now fully functional and ready to use! The debug panel will help you identify any configuration issues.
