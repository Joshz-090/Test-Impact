## 🎉 **Gallery Enhancement Complete!**

I've successfully enhanced the Gallery page with comprehensive search and filter functionality. Here's what's been implemented:

### ✅ **New Features Added:**

#### 🔍 **Smart Search Functionality**

- **Search Bar**: Real-time search by title or description

- **Instant Results**: No need to press enter, results update as you type

#### 🎛️ **Advanced Filtering System**

- **Category Filter**: Filter images by category (Events, Artwork, Team, Projects, Community, Other)
- **Sort Options**:
  - Newest First (default)
  - Oldest First
  - Title A-Z
- **Filter Toggle**: Collapsible filter panel
- **Active Filter Indicator**: Shows number of active filters with badge
